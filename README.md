# Bootstrap 4 test page

## *Sample page for **[Bootstrap 4.0.0-beta](https://getbootstrap.com/)***

**You can [download][dl] it and replace the URL of Bootstrap CSS to your custom stylesheet to test it.**

## Notes

* I added [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) to the code block with *Atom one dark* theme. (Toggleable.)
* The page is assembled using Jekyll, you can find and download the single HTML in **[Releases][dl]**.
